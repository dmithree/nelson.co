# Gavin Nelson Design

The code repository that powers [my personal website and portfolio.](https://www.gnelsondesign.com)

Built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home)

Done as a [React](https://reactjs.org) learning exercise, so the code might a bit rough around the edges.
