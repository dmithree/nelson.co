# Real thinking requires a form of externalization

The brain is a machine for jumping to conclusions. To avoid this and to really think and understand, the process must be externalized (see [[Paraphrasing insight leads to better understanding]]).

[[Evergreen notes]] often function as external scaffolding for thinking that allow the brain to focus on thinking rather than remembering.

Externalizing thinking, particularly through writing, helps fully explore the intricacies of ideas and think through details (see [[Writing is the best form of learning]]).

A side effect of understanding that [[Real thinking requires a form of externalization]] is understanding that the format of reading isn’t conducive to real thinking and learn as [[Andy Matuschak]] details in [[Why Books Dont Work]].

Combining the ideas in [[Why Books Dont Work]] and [[Real thinking requires a form of externalization]] can take us to the conclusion that [[Effective reading comes through highlighting and writing]].
