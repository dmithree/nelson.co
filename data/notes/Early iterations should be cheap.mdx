# Early iterations should be cheap

Keeping early iterations cheap allows you to quickly discard and progress ideas based on feedback.

If iteration takes too much time or effort, they will have a higher cost, and be harder to detach from and discard when needed.

Creating a successful product requires many things to go right. The most feasible way to get so many things right is to try a ton of ideas and iterations and scrap the ones that are wrong.

If we subscribe to [[Real thinking requires a form of externalization]] keeping early iteration cheap becomes even more important as externalizing thought takes time and effort.

For my practice I like to start with writing as the best early, cheap form of learning (see [[Writing is the best form of learning]]. This isnâ€™t necessarily something that should be used as the atomic level of discussion however. Writing is fantastic for externalizing ideas as you generate them, however [[Prototypes function more successfully as the atomic unit of discussion]].
