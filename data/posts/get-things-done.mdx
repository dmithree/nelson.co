# Get Things Done

#### Started, February 2, 2021

I’ve been using [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) for years to manage tasks, projects, and just general... _things_. The app is based loosely off the principles of _Getting Things Done_, a book that promotes a productivity framework of capturing, organizing, and acting on tasks and ideas. The high level ideas of Getting Things Done mesh well with how I naturally operate, but I find learning and sticking to every little part of the system is a sizable project in and of itself.

<br />

Instead, I operate on a modification of the GTD system that is pared down to its
basics with the goal of being simple enough to stick to, but powerful enough to be
effective. My minimal framework was made specifically for use with Things, but you
should be able to use most task management platforms (or even pencil and paper) to
implement it.

## Collection

Start by forming the habit of collecting your tasks and ideas the moment you think of them. Toss them all into the Things _Inbox_ and worry about triage and organization later. Do whatever you can to minimize the friction of recording actionable tasks. A get things done system is no good if you can’t remember what you have to get done.

## Triage

At least once a day, go through the Inbox and triage its contents based on the following questions:

- Is it an item that is actionable and can be completed?
- Will it take more than one action to complete?
- What broad _Area_ does the task belong to?
- When does it need to be done?

### Is it an item that is actionable and can be completed?

You’ll notice a lot of this framework ( and GTD as a whole) hinges on _next action_ items. Next action items should be the immediate next physical, visible action that you can take to get closer to completing the task. This will help remove abstraction from tasks and projects, which I find tend to cause stress and procrastination.

<br />

So if your Inbox item being triaged is a clear action item itself, perfect. If not, either reframe the item as something actionable, discard it, or move it to your notes.

### Will it take more than one action to complete?

If an item will take more than one action to complete, turn it into a project.* The golden rule with a project is to make sure that it always has a *next action item\* and like tasks. If you complete all of the tasks within the project, you’ve either completed the project, or there are more action items to add.

#### \*Things has a handy “convert to project” option that will take the selected item and turn it into a project item for you - use this often!

### What broad Area does the task belong to?

Take a second during triage to move tasks to Things’ _Areas_ as well*.* I find Areas work best as a means of high level organization. For example, I have _Personal, Design, Website,_ and _Work_ areas that hold all of my projects and tasks. These areas can be fluid; create them and delete them as needed, but try and keep the number of areas down and their scope broad.

### When does it need to be done?

It’s important not to overthink this one. If you don’t immediately know a specific day or date that the item _has_ to be completed on don’t assign it a date. Only toss it in Things’ _Today_ list if it needs to be done today, otherwise leave it in the default _Anytime_ list.

## Reviewing

After tasks are collected and sorted, it’s time to review them and get started on completing them. My system relies on two reviews - one every day, and one every week. I like to complete the daily review every morning as I’m starting my day and the weekly review every Sunday night before the start of the next work week, but you can do whatever works best for you. Neither of these should take more than three minutes once you get the hang of it.

<br />

For the weekly review, focus on identifying things you want to get done _this week_. Open up the Someday list, and move anything out of it and into the Anytime list that you want to get done this week. Double check that all projects and tasks are based on next actionable items.

<br />

For the daily review, open up the now full Anytime list and pick a few things that you want to get done today. Start with just a small number of tasks. Dan Eden’s article, [3×3 GTD: A Priority-Driven To Do List](https://daneden.me/blog/2020/3x3-gtd) even recommends even focusing on three tasks a day that work towards three larger goals a year. If you complete everything on your Today list, you can always dive back into the Anytime list to grab more tasks, but having a seemingly endless list of tasks in the Today list is a good way to get stressed out and abandon Things altogether.

That is the core of my minimal framework. It may sound like a lot while reading through it, but in reality the whole thing takes a few minutes a day to organize. There are more levels of detail you can go to with things like tags for items, but try not to go overboard. I have a `work` tag that gets automatically assigned to every item in my _Work_ area to allow for easy filtering while I’m working, but that’s it.

<br />

The simpler you can keep it, the easier it is to stick to it.
