# Effective Reading

There is so much great knowledge captured through text but as [Andy Matuschak](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak) pointed out in [_Why Books Don't Work_](https://andymatuschak.org/books/) ([highlights](https://nelson.co/highlights#159664527)), learning through reading is fairly inefficient and ineffective. The problem is that reading to learn relies on transmissionism — the discredited idea that knowledge can be directly transmitted from sentence to reader.

<br></br>

Reading Andy’s article didn’t change the fact there's a lot I want to learn from
books, articles, tweet threads, etc., but it has changed how I try and learn it.
[Readwise](https://readwise.io) is a [tool I use](/posts/digital-tools) to
reinforce the most important bits of information I read through the [spaced
repetition learning technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)
that has shown to be an effective way of committing information to long term
memory.

<br></br>

My experience tells me that there is a lot of benefit to be realized _just_ from consciously highlighting periodically while you read and spending a few minutes to review these highlights. If you want to take it a step further however, I’ve been experimenting with expanding upon my highlights by forming connections and creating what Andy Matuschak calls [_evergreen notes_](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) from the ideas as well.

<br></br>

If these ideas resonate with you, below is an outline of my workflow for more effective reading.

## Capture

One of the trickiest things to figure out with this workflow was learning _what_ to highlight while reading. It’s easy to find yourself mindlessly highlighting things that you already know. However you’ll get more value out of this system if you focus on only highlighting key concepts and claims the author makes - thinking of highlighting “surprising” things is often a good filter.

<br></br>

As far as physically highlighting something goes, Readwise offers a variety of tools to help you get that done. I try and make most of my online article reading happen in [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) for a variety of reasons, one of which is the ability to automatically sync highlights created with it to Readwise.

<br></br>

There are a surprising amount of mediums that Readwise will handle highlights from (even PDF highlights through an email address, transcribed podcast clips through the Airr app, and physical book highlights through OCR technology built into their iOS app), the important part is that you are capturing content as you read.

## Review

This is the part where spaced repetition learning comes into play. Now that you have collected a group of highlights, you want to review a small chunk of them every day to better remember the ideas that you spent time reading. Again, Readwise makes this very easy by sending a daily email digest and having a “daily review” section in their app and even provides a bit of motivation via keeping track of streaks and maintaining a leaderboard.

<br></br>

You can tweak the spaced repetition settings to favor older or more recent highlights and adjust how many highlights you want to see for a daily review. I skewed my settings slightly towards the older highlights end, bumped the daily review number up to 6 highlights and read through them first thing in the morning. I’d rather review 6 highlights a day, everyday, than try and read 30 highlights a day but only get to it some days.

## Synthesize

Inspired by projects like [Andy’s Working Notes](https://nelson.co/highlightsfeed.xml), [Ehsan's Notes](https://notes.thisisehsan.com/D+Public+Notes/Ehsan's+Notes), and [Maggie's Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden), I wanted to do something with the highlights I had been collecting and learning from. This section of the workflow is largely optional — like I said earlier you can reap a lot of benefits simply from reviewing what you read.

<br></br>

Readwise has an export to Markdown feature that will take all of your highlights and compile customizable Markdown documents per highlight source that you can then use how you wish ([my export settings here](https://gist.github.com/gavinmn/5d5bfc52249ad0d52f0fba6dcc4d29ae)).

<br></br>

I periodically export my highlight markdown files and import them into [Craft](https://www.craft.do) where I will comb through the highlights again and try and distill key concepts and ideas into my own concise summaries. While doing this, I try to keep in mind other highlights that express similar themes to reference and build a more complete picture of the concept.

<br></br>

Charles Broskoski put it best in [his interview for The Creative Independent](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/charles-broskoski-on-self-discovery-upon-revisiting-things-youve-accumulated-over-time/) ([highlights](https://nelson.co/highlights#171658421)),

> there’s a self-discovery that happens when you revisit things you’ve accumulated over a period of time. You look back and begin to recognize patterns in your own thinking.

<br></br>

These patterns that emerge encapsulate what this part of the process is about. We have read new ideas, learned them and can recall them, and now want to put them to use by expanding upon them and creating original ideas.

---

I encourage you to take what I have described above and adapt it to be something that works for you. I’m not in love with the fact that I’ve added friction to the act of reading with this whole process but I do it because I enjoy revisiting what I find interesting while reading, and I figure if I’m going to spend the time reading something that I can learn from, I may as well actually effectively learn from it.
